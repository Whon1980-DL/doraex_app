### Data Models

1. AllAuth User Model
    * Django Allauth, the User model is the default user model provided by the Django authentication system
    * The User entity has a one-to-many relationship with the Renting entity. This means that a User can have multiple Rantings, but each Renting is associated with only one User.
---
2. Category Model

### User Journey 

![User Journey](documentation/readme_images/user_journey.png)

### Database Scheme

Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

![DataScheme](documentation/readme_images/erd.png)

* The Customer entity represents customers that can be associated with renting, with fields id as the primary key. first_name for first name, last_name for last name, age for age and contact detail etc.
* The Category entity represents category to group gadget together with a field of category name.
* The Gadget entity represents individual gadget listings, with fields id as the primary key, name for the gadget's name, description for the gadget's description, price for the gadget's price, image for the gadget's image, minimun_use_age for age restriction, and warning and intended use for customer guideline.
* The Renting entity represents a renting made by a customer for a specific gadget, with fields id as the primary key, gadget as a foreign key referencing the Gadget entity, customer as a foreign key referencing the Customer entity, start_date for the renting start date, end_date for gadget return date, number_days_rent  for rent duration and total_price is calculate using a decorator function.

This data scheme allows for the management of users, customer, category, gadget, and renting. Users can make renting for specific gadgets, and each renting can have associated details such as the start_date, rent duration and quantity of gadget to rent.
